## When the Dream Garden Was Born

This is a personal worldbuilding effort which began with me being too lazy to learn the Forgotten Realms lore when a group of friends asked me to DM a Dungeons and Dragon's session. I compiled some names I had used when creating RPG characters from video games and I began the development of this world. The world has gone through many re-writes, though keeping many key moments and characters. The goal of this world, now that I do not utilize it for TTRPGs is to create as human and realistic of a world as the world allows. I may write stories for it, and have written a few, but the intent is far less grand than that. <br>

## The Purpose of this Wiki

This Vault is primarily used to keep track of everything. I learned, through the many notebooks I started and got only a few pages into before needing a new one, that I am prone to loosing my notes. Given that the notes I do find from time to time are awful, I see no issue leaving them to be forgotten. My hope is to create effective and decent notes to bring order to the world that has been taking up too much of my mind, and to create the foundation for further use. <br>

## Copywrite

I am vehemently opposed to the use of copywrite protections to prevent others from using fictional ideas, and as such I want to make it clear that anything in this world can be used freely. No one actually creates anything, we mold looser or stronger ideas into an image and then carve that image to life. I see no issue with owning the right to claim you are the 'creator' of something, but to go so far as to exclude the use of your creation makes no sense to me. Stories are stories and characters are character, if someone can write a character I have molded better than I can, then I am happy. It makes sense to have copywrite to ensure plagiarism doesn't exist, or to prevent someone from claiming they were the actual creator, but money seems more able to afford these protections than actual creation status. If a corporation copies someone else's idea, and has enough money, then they can get away with it. If someone copies a corporation's idea and lacks enough money, they will not get away with it. Copywrite laws seem to favor corporate interests, not artist interests, removing that power from corporations seems more valuable than any benefit they bring. <br>

I would appreciate 'notification of use' and an 'inspiration reference' in your works if you knowingly use something found herein, but I will never attempt to coerce a user of my ideas into paying me royalties unless plagiarism without reference is done. Feel free to adapt anything seen here into other mediums. Feel free <br>
