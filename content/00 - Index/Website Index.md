**Welcome to my Sanctuary**!

This is a staticly generated site based on markdown files used in Obsidian.md. You can think of it like a wiki. You can follow in-text links to other notes. You can also use the search bar or the graph to find new notes. 

This library is hosted through [[Github Pages]] using [[Quartz]] and [[Obsidian]]. You can have your own site with the same structure and I highly encourage this. A goal with this site is to adapt it into a larger [[00 - Body of Human Knowledge|project]]. Which crosslinks the notes from those who create a site using the same program to have an incredibly large databate of notes.

This website is technically a [[What is a Blog|blog]], though I don't care for that name as when I think of blogs I think of a [[What is a Facade|facade]]. Marketing myself as someone other than myself seems like creating an image of myself that I want to be prideful of. I would rather discontinue this project than let it drive me to pride and I feel that blogs, masks, and pride go hand-in-hand.
