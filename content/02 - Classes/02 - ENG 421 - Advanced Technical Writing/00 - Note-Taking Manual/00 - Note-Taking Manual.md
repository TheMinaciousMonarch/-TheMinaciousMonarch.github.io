## Purpose and Creation Philosophy

This manual acts as a guide for those who haven't perfected their skills in note-taking. The intent of this manual is **not** to write exhaustively on all of the details and theories related to note-taking. I find that kind of exercize to be a feat of personal gain and pride rather than being useful for others. A hammer is a good tool because just about anyone can use it. Each word reduces the usability of a manual as each word increases the likelihood of someone discontinuing it.
