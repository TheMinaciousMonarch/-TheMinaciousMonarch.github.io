Application Typography and Working in Word

Design a typographic manual defining twelve of the words in Chapter 6 of Arnston - Unising Text Type

Words I am choosing, 
Roman: The standard characters of a font in which the characters are uptight and not boldface.
Italics: A slanted version of a Roman type design originally derived from cursive handwriting
Old Style: Type category characterized by mild contrast between thicks and thins, and by bracketed serifs
Transitional: Category of type that blends old style and modern, with emphasis on thick and thin contrast and gracefully bracketed serifs.
Modern: Type category that has great variation between thick and thin strokes and thin, un-bracketed serifs
Egyptian: A slab-serif type category
Sans Serif: Letterforms without serifs, the stroke that projects off the main stroke of a letter at the bottom or the top.
Widow: Short line at the end of a paragraph that falls at the top of bottom of a column page, or a single word on a line by itself at the end of a paragraph. Also called an orphan.
Orphan: A short line that falls at the bottom of a column of text.
Justified: To align lines of a type that are equal in length so both edges of the column are straight
Flush Left: Format that aligns text to the left
Flush Right: Format that aligns text to the right
