Client Project Proposal

From: Brandon Dye
Subject: Client Project Proposal; Notetaking From Zero to One Handbook
Date: 

## The Purpose

This memorandum is meant to propose and explain the *Zero to One Wiki*, wherein I utilize information I have gained from redeveloping several skills to help others reshape their thinking and develop these skills themselves. This is a joint project which will utilize some aspects of other course requirments, including the blog and website. This project will be directly combined with the *Zero to One Blog*, the blog being the formalized and published content and the wiki being the aspects which may change frequently and it will be designed through

## Conclusion

I would like my client project to be to create a guide/wiki related to a concept I describe as "From Zero to One" and the specific part of the guide I will make for this project will be related to notetaking. *From Zero to One* is based on the idea of 'from one to one-hunded'. I notice that there is an absolute abundance of content online, especially related to student skills, which I would categorize as 'from one to one-hundred'. This content may be described using the words, boost, multiply, skyrocket, or grow. This content is largely based on teaching qucik tips and changes to what someone is already doing and claiming that these small changes will compound into excellerated growth in a given skill. I have tried more of these plans than I can count and I have found that nearly all of these have failed for the same reasons, they skip a step and they assume the big-picture.
