Hi all,

My Client Project began with a personal struggle with the topic of note-taking. I am not and have never been particularly good at taking notes. I was forced to take notes by the teachers of some of my classes in Primary and Secondary Education but this likely only hindered my development of this skill. I gave up on even trying to take notes sometime around the age of sixteen and relied on memory. This worked to varying degrees until a head injury when I was twenty-two which hindered my memory. I noticed a sudden drop in my ability to recall information for my classes and I began to learn how to take notes by watching youtube videos by learning experts. 

I found that few of these videos were spectacular at motivating my to take note but lackluster in showing me how. I began to critically think about their content and I realized that the reason that these videos failed me is because these videos aren't for me. No one is actually teaching note-taking from scratch. Imagine looking up "How to Jump Start A Car" and getting videos saying, "Electricity can be generated in one vehicle and this energy is capable of being stored in another vehicle, thus allowing the dead vehicle to start once fully charged." You may leave the video knowing more but when you go to jump-start a car, you'll find that you don't actually know how. This is the experience of learning how to take notes online.

I eventually found myself reading teacher's manuals from the ninteenth and twentieth centuries about how to nurture this skill in children and I had my "Ahha" moment. Two weeks later, this class began.

My project began with refering back to the teacher's manuals I read before and deciding that in order to help, I need to create three things. The first is behind-the-scenes note examples, the second is public critical analysis of poor note-taking advise, and the third is a simple manual that can get someone started.

These three ideals evolved into a more simple project. I could make a resource library, a blog, and a manual. I then realized that the blog and resource library could easily be merged into a single entity.

I began my project by sending an unsolicited survey to friends, family, and reddit. This survey quotes "Learning Experts" and asked if people understood what was meant in the quote, I then asked for people to explain the quotes. I asked other questions, such as the frequency of note-taking, if someone was a student, what job-fields they are in, and demographical questions. 

From over two-hundred respondants, I realized that my theory was correct. No one knows what "Learning Experts" are saying and everyone is just filling in the holes with their own expectations on what they mean.

I established the ground-rules for my Library and began refining my school notes, providing explanations for my refinment, and working on a simply rule-set for note-taking that I could use for my manual. I recorded a few commentary videos on "Learning Experts" and figured out how to locally host my Library.

---

After doing this, I realized what the most refined set of rules for note-taking is. I then worked on the manual. The intention here was not to be long-winded, but also to put enough content into it that I wouldn't fail the project.

The most simple ruleset is this;
1. Write stuff down in a way that feels coherent. 
2. Read your note later, long enough to forget most of the content. 
3. Take a note on your note that feels coherent. 
4. Once you have at least thirty updated notes, use intuition to see what changed. 
5. Adjust accordingly.

I then added some categories that one could think of that may make it easier to get the first step rolling.

I continued refining notes in my Library and had some friends visit it. I asked them to perform a few key tasks and report back with their findings. This went rather well.
