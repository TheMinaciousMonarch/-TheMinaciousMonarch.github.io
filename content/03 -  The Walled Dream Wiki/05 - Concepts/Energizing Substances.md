# Energizing Substances

---

- The process of energizing substances varies by which substance and which energy one uses. 
- The difficulty to energize a substance can be dirrectly corelated to the density of the subject, though Ostea are typically resistant beyond their density. 
- Air is the most difficult common substance to energize
- All gemstones have a preference to some energies over others. Gemstones tend to be entirely resistant to those energies which they do not favor and gemstones tend to be able to store significant amounts of energy from those energies they do favor.
- Most metals are prone to melting when energized by any energy.
- Gold, silver, copper, and platinum are suseptable to melting but they also have unique energies which they store and emit.
