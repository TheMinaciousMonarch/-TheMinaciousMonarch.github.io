Formed at the molding of the world, Aiel's Tower was made as the throne for the god of seasons. It is said that if you reach the top you can see anything from Aiel's throne, you can see the sea in all directions. How many people have attempted to scale the tower is beyond count but it can be said that no more than 30 have ever reached the top and even then only 3 have ever claimed to have and have been able to.
