## Purpose and Creation Philosophy

This manual acts as a guide for those who haven't perfected their skills in note-taking. The intent of this manual is **not** to write exhaustively on all of the details and theories related to note-taking. I find that kind of exercise to be a feat of personal gain and pride rather than being useful for others. A hammer is a good tool because just about anyone can use it. Each word reduces the usability of a manual as each word increases the likelihood of someone discontinuing it.

## PDF Version

A version of this project has also been uploaded in PDF form and can be viewed [[Note-Taking Manual PDF.pdf|here]]. The PDF version is condensed and focuses on the essentials of getting started. The purpose of that version is to develop the concept of [[01 - Notebook/Solvitur Ambulando]] and then solicit practice of the skill of note-taking.
