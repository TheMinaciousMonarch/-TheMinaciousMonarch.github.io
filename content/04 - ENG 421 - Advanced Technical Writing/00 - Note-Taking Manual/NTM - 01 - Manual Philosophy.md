Go Up [[00 - Note-Taking Manual]]

Nearly 80 years ago (1946) George Orwell wrote, "Vagueness and sheer incompetence is the most marked characteristic of modern English prose... As soon as certain topics are raised, the concrete melts into the abstract... prose consists less and less of _words_ chosen for the sake of their meaning, and more and more of _phrases_..." Given all the useless pages of information I was forced to read in school, I am still shocked that I never read *Politics and the English Language* by George Orwell. Within his essay, Orwell writes about the impurity, ugliness, and inaccuracy of the use of the English language in the Post-War Era. The essay focuses on the language of politics, but the politics of previous centuries becomes the life of the present. I took this essay to heart and have begun to hone my language so as to not waste other's time.
