Go Up [[00 - Note-Taking Manual]]

I was blessed for much of my education to not need to study. I was able to perform well by just listening during class. The only form of studying I did involved me talking to my peers about the subject material and thinking about it. This was excellent for classes that I cared about, but I underperformed in those subject that were disinteresting or when the teacher was boring. I could expect a B so long as a class wasn't homework heavy. I received a head injury in January of 2020 which hindered my ability recall significant portions of new information. I noticed this decline around September of that year and realized that my note-taking system was no-longer sufficient. I contacted a few resources but realized that my University offered very little that would actually help. I decided to learn how to take notes as a 21-year-old.
