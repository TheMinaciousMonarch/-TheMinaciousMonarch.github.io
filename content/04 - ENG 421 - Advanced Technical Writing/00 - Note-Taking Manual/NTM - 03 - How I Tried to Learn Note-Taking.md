Go Up [[00 - Note-Taking Manual]]

---

I watched hundreds of hours of content related to note-taking and tried more methods than I can remember. Each of these attempts began with a rush of energy and an idea of what direction to go, and ended with me forgetting about it or being burnt out. I realized that what burned me out of most systems was a need to spend a large potion of time preparing notes before writing them. I attempted to create my own system many times and I continued to fail to make something that felt right and was useful. I had hundreds of pages of various notes from my past and I realized that what I had been doing up to then was trying to categorize my previous notes. I was spending more time thinking of how to format my notes than thinking about my notes. I recalled that thinking about a subject is what helped me perform well in said subject and I realized that nearly all of the information I found online was putting my mind in a position where I was thinking more about note-taking-theory than taking notes.
