Go Up [[00 - Note-Taking Manual]]

---

So I did something unreasonable. I just started taking notes in the way that felt right. I started by writing what I will now call 'Journals' but at the time, it was just writing in the way that felt most comfortable. I had no goal in my notes other than to create them and later analyze them. I chose to study by breaking down my notes in ways that my gut told me to try. I did not create any rules, I simply looked at my notes and played around with them. This is the moment I realized the error, or oversight, that plagues content related to learning how to take notes; they do not teach it from scratch. Videos on note-taking tend to be from experts in memory, or people who are successful. Most of these people learned how to take note when they were young enough that they simply cannot remember starting from scratch. They all use conglomerate words which, if you do not define in the exact same way, would lead you to never actually understand them. Rather than trying to correct all of the ills of this field, I hope to create a handbook which actually helps.
