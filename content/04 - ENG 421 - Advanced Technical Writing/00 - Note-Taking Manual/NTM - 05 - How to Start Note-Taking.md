## How to Start Note-Taking

To begin note-taking for the first time you must do two things. You must take notes and you must refine your notes. How you take your notes matters VERY little, so long as there are enough words to work with. Refining your notes can take any form, even increasing their length or splitting a note into multiple notes. The way this is done also matters little. It is through refining your notes that you get better at taking your notes. You cannot become a better note-taker by taking notes, you get better by refining your mind. When you keep your mind in the state of refinement, you start refining your notes as you write them, because your mind is thinking in a refined version of your language. But, notes are never fully refined. Reviewing notes often keeps notes updated.
