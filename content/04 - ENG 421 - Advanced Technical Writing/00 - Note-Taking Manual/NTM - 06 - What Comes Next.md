## What Comes Next?

I am aware that I am imperfect. Although the directions for how to begin taking notes seems clear to me, I am confident that it will not make sense to everyone.

Refinement is the key to note-taking, but it is useless unless the key is in your hand. This handbook should plant the seeds of note-taking that you may reap them.
