I was watching a channel called Canela and in it the narrator describes the body language of dogs as they interact at a dog park, and what that language means to the dogs. The dogs' body language communication appeared to be far more complex and understood than most human body language communication. So I wrote;

"I think that animals are better at body language communication than humans because humans have two forms of communication, that being verbal and non-verbal. It could be the case that being able to rely on one of these for 99% of interactions leads us to not bother noticing the other. But we do still use body language, I think we just don't rationalize it."

This was rather dense and loaded with thoughts.

So I applied some basic rules given my purpose in taking notes is to bring clarity to my thoughts. Given my thoughts are jumbled and dense, breaking my thoughts apart is typically ideal.

I broke apart linking thoughts and turned them into acting thoughts.

"It could be the case that being able to rely on one of these for 99% of interactions leads us to not bother noticing the other." **This is a very wordy theory and contains unclear thoughts here is a breakdown on why.**

It could be the case -> Tag:: Theory

that = Linking verb

being able to rely on - Loaded with the idea of 'reliance' making it seem like humans are dependent on verbal language and that it is a bad thing.

these -> verbal communication

for 99% of interactions - hyperbole and goes back to sounding like we are dependent.

leads us = moving to point

to not bother noticing - "not bother" sounds like we neglect body language and are failing to be responsible.

the other -> body language
