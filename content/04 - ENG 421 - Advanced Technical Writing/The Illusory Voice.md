The illusory voices enticed me to return,
First, I sought to ignore them,
This failed,
Second, I sought to silence them,
They grew louder,
Third, I sought bring them into me,
But they were already there,
Finally, I did not seek,
Then all things left me.

I awoke then from a brief infinite slumber,
Only 5 minutes having past by my watch,
Only a single eternity within my mind.

Born again unto this world,
The voices welcomed me back not,
For they truly never left me.
