### Ingredients (2 Serving)

-   1 lb green asparagus, ends trimmed
-   3 oz. bacon, cooked crisp and chopped
-   4 large, hard-boiled eggs, peeled and halved
-   2 tbsp avocado oil or olive oil
-   2 tbsp red wine vinegar
-   1 tbsp Dijon mustard
-   1 tbsp bacon fat
-   1 garlic clove, minced
-   1 pinch sea salt
-   1 pinch red chili flakes

### Instructions

1.  Cut the trimmed asparagus into 1 to 2" (3-5 cm) segments.
    
2.  Bring a large salted pot of water to a boil. Once the water has come to a rolling boil, drop the asparagus in and boil for 3 to 4 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove the asparagus from the boiling water and transfer to an ice bath to stop the cooking process and lock in the color.
    
3.  In a small mixing bowl, combine the oil, vinegar, mustard, bacon fat, garlic, salt, and pepper flakes. Whisk to combine.
    
4.  Plate the asparagus in a large serving dish. Sprinkle the bacon over top and arrange the hard-boiled eggs. Drizzle with vinaigrette. Serve any remaining vinaigrette on the side.
