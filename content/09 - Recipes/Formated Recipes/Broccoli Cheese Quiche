2 cups broccoli florets, about ½ pound

▢5 large eggs

▢¾ cup milk, I used whole milk

▢½ teaspoon salt

▢¼ teaspoon pepper

▢1 cup shredded cheddar cheese

▢1 9-inch whole wheat pie crust

INSTRUCTIONS

 

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.

Roll out pie crust, if not already shaped, and chill until ready to use.

Place 1-2 cups water in the bottom of a small pot. Add the broccoli, cover, and bring to a boil. Cook the broccoli until crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Transfer broccoli to a colander, rinse with cool water, and drain. Chop broccoli into small pieces.

In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, salt and pepper. Stir in the chopped broccoli and cheddar cheese. Pour into the prepared pie shell.

Bake quiche for 35-40 minutes, until eggs are set in the center. Check on quiche starting at 25 minutes and tent with foil if crust is browning too quickly.

Let stand for 5 minutes before servin
