#Recipe/Dinner 

#### Ingredients:
4 medium artichokes 
1 lemon, juiced
¼ cup olive oil 
2 cloves garlic, minced 
½ cup white wine
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried basil
½ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon black pepper 

#### Instructions: 
Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil. Trim the artichokes by cutting off the top 1 inch and snipping the tips of the leaves. Rub the cut surfaces with lemon juice to prevent browning. Place the artichokes in the pot of boiling water and cook them for 20-25 minutes, or until they are tender. Drain the artichokes and set them aside to cool. Heat the olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the garlic and sauté until it is fragrant. Stir in the white wine, oregano, basil, salt, and black pepper. Add the cooled artichokes to the pan and turn them to coat them with the sauce. Reduce the heat to low and simmer the artichokes for 10-15 minutes, or until they are heated through. Serve the artichokes hot, with the sauce spooned over the top.
