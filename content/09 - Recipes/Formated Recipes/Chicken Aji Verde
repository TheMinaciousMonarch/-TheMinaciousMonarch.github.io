Ingredients
Chicken:
2 pounds chicken thighs (boneless, skinless)
5 cloves garlic (peeled)
1/3 cup soy sauce
2 Tablespoons lime juice
1 Tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
2 teaspoons cumin
1 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
Black pepper
Green Sauce:
3 jalapeños (seeded, ribs removed and roughly chopped)
1 cup fresh cilantro leaves
2 green onions (chopped (green parts only) )
2 cloves garlic (peeled)
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup Greek yogurt
1 Tablespoon lime juice
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
2 Tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
Instructions
Chicken:
Puree garlic, soy sauce, lime juice, oil, cumin, paprika, oregano and a pinch of black pepper in a blender.
Put chicken in a large ziploc bag and add marinade. Place in refrigerator and allow to marinate for 8 to 24 hours.
Green Sauce:
Combine all ingredients except the olive oil in a blender process until smooth. With the motor running, slowly drizzle in olive oil. Transfer to a bowl and refrigerate until ready to serve.
Grill chicken:
Preheat grill to medium-high heat (around 350-degrees). Remove chicken from marinade and shake off any extra marinade. Place on the grill grates. Let chicken cook for 5-6 minutes with the grill cover closed to maintain the heat. Use tongs to flip the chicken thighs. Cook for an additional 5-6 minutes. Use a digital thermometer to make sure internal temperature reaches 165°F.
OR – In oven:
Preheat the oven to 500 degrees and place the chicken pieces in a 13×9 inch roasting pan. Add 1 cup water to the pan. Bake uncovered for 30 minutes, then tent the pan with foil and cook for an additional 15 minutes, until the chicken is fully cooked. (The internal temperature should reach 165°F.)
