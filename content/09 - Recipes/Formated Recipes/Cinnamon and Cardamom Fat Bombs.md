# Cinnamon and cardamom fat bombs

#Recipe 
#Recipe/Snack

### Ingredients (10 Servings)

-   3 oz. (6 tbsp) unsalted butter
-   ½ cup (1½ oz.) unsweetened finely shredded coconut
-   1 tsp ground cardamom (green)
-   1 tsp ground cinnamon
-   ½ tsp vanilla extract

### Instructions

1.  Bring the butter to room temperature.
    
2.  Carefully toast the shredded coconut in a dry pan over medium high heat, until lightly browned. This will enhance the coconut flavor, but you can skip this if you want. Let cool.
    
3.  Combine butter, half of the shredded coconut, and spices in a bowl. Chill mixture in refrigerator for 5-10 minutes, until slightly firm.
    
4.  Form into walnut sized (roughly 1" or 2.5 cm) balls. Then roll the balls in the remaining shredded coconut.
    
5.  Store in refrigerator or freezer.
