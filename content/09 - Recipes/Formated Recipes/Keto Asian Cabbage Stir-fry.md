### Ingredients (4 Servings)

-   1 lb green cabbage
-   2 oz. butter, divided or coconut oil
-   1 tsp salt
-   1 tsp onion powder
-   ¼ tsp ground black pepper
-   1 tbsp white wine vinegar
-   2 garlic cloves, minced
-   1 tsp chili flakes
-   2 tbsp finely chopped, or grated, fresh ginger
-   1¼ lbs ground beef or ground turkey
-   3 (1½ oz.) scallions, chopped in 1/2" (1.5 cm) slices
-   1 tbsp sesame oil

### Instructions

1.  Shred the cabbage finely using a sharp knife or a food processor.
    
2.  Fry the cabbage in half of the butter in a large frying or wok pan on medium-high heat. It takes a while for the cabbage to soften, but don't let it turn brown.
    
3.  Add spices and vinegar. Stir and fry for a couple of minutes more. Put the cabbage in a bowl.
    
4.  Melt the rest of the butter in the same frying pan. Add garlic, chili flakes and ginger. Sauté for a few minutes.
    
5.  Add ground meat and brown until the meat is thoroughly cooked and most of the juices have evaporated. Lower the heat a little.
    
6.  Add scallions and cabbage to the meat. Stir until everything is hot. Salt and pepper to taste. Drizzle with sesame oil before serving.
