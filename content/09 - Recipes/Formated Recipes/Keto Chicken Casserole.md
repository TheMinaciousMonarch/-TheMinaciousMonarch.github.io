#Recipe/Breakfast 

### Ingredients (6 Servings)

-   ¾ cup heavy whipping cream
-   ½ cup (4 oz.) cream cheese
-   3 tbsp [green pesto](https://www.dietdoctor.com/recipes/classic-pesto)
-   1 tbsp lemon juice
-   salt and pepper
-   1½ oz. butter
-   2 lbs skinless boneless chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces
-   6 oz. leeks, finely chopped
-   4 oz. cherry tomatoes, halved
-   ¾ lb cauliflower, cut into small florets
-   2 cups (8 oz.) cheddar cheese, shredded

### Instructions

1.  Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).
    
2.  Mix cream and cream cheese with pesto and lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
    
3.  In a large pan over medium-high heat, melt the butter. Add the chicken, season with salt and pepper, and fry until they turn a nice golden brown.
    
4.  Place the chicken in a greased 9 x 13" (23 x 33 cm) baking dish, and pour in the cream mixture.
    
5.  Top chicken with leek, tomatoes, and cauliflower.
    
6.  Sprinkle cheese on top and bake in the middle of the oven for at least 30 minutes or until the chicken is fully cooked. If the casserole is at risk of burning before it's done, cover it with a piece of aluminium foil, lower the heat and let cook for a little longer.
