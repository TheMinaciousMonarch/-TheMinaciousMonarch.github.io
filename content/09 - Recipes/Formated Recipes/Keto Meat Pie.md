### Instructions

### Meat filling

1.  Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).
    
2.  Heat the butter or olive oil in a large frying pan, over medium heat. Add the onion and cook for a few minutes until tender. Add the garlic, ground beef, oregano or basil, salt, and pepper. Use a spatula to break the meat into smaller pieces, while mixing together. Cook for 8-10 minutes or until no longer pink.
    
3.  Add the tomato paste, water, and stir to combine. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer uncovered for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, prepare the pie crust.
    

### Pie crust

5.  Mix the crust ingredients together using a food processor, or with a fork.
    
6.  Place a round piece of parchment paper in a well-greased, 9-10" (23-25 cm) springform pan, or deep-dish pie pan. Using a spatula or well-greased fingers, evenly press the dough onto the base and the sides of the pan. Prick the base and sides of the crust with a fork, to prevent bubbling.
    
7.  Pre-bake the crust for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and place the meat mixture in the crust.
    
8.  In a small bowl, combine the cottage cheese and shredded cheese. Spread on top of the pie.
    
9.  Bake on the lower rack for 30-40 minutes, or until golden in color.
