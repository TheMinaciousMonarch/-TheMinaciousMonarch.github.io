6. Transfer the bacon strips on a plate lined with paper towels and set aside. 
7. Reduce the flame to medium low under the same frying pan with the bacon fat still in it. 
8. Stir in the onion and sauté until translucent for about 3 minutes.

13. Whisk well until smooth and creamy. 
14. Fold in the Swiss and Gruyere cheeses with a pinch of salt and pepper. 
15. Then, chop the cooled bacon strips and fold them into the egg and heavy cream mixture as well, followed by the onion and garlic mixture. 
16. Mix everything well. Pour the mixture into the prepared mini pie pan. 
17. Place the pan inside the preheated oven and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the quiche Lorraine is cooked through and firm. 
18. Transfer the pan to a cooling rack and let stand for about 5 minutes.
