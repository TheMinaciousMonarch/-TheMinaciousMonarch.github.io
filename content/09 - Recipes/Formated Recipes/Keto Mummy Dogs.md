### Ingredients (4 Servings)

-   ½ cup (2 oz.) [almond flour](https://www.dietdoctor.com/ingredients/almond-flour)
-   4 tbsp coconut flour
-   ½ tsp salt
-   1 tsp baking powder
-   2½ oz. butter
-   6 oz. (1½ cups) mozzarella cheese, shredded
-   1 egg
-   1 lb sausages in links, or uncured hot dogs
-   1 egg, for brushing the dough
-   16 cloves, for the mummies eyes (optional)

### Instructions

1.  Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).
    
2.  Mix almond flour, coconut flour and baking powder in a large bowl.
    
3.  Melt the butter and cheese in a pan on low heat. Stir thoroughly with a wooden spoon, for a smooth and flexible batter. After a few minutes, remove from heat.
    
4.  Stir the egg into to the flour mixture, and then add the cheese mixture, combining all until it becomes a firm dough.
    
5.  Flatten into a rectangle, about 8×14 inches (20×35 cm).
    
6.  Cut into 8 long strips, less than an inch wide (1.5–2 cm).
    
7.  Wrap the dough strips around the hot dog and brush with a whisked egg.
    
8.  Place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake for 15–20 minutes until the dough is golden brown. The hot dog will be done by then too.
    
9.  Push two cloves into each hot dog to make them look like eyes – but only for decoration. Don’t eat the cloves!
