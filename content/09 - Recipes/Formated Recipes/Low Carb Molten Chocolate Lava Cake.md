# Low carb molten chocolate lava cake

#Recipe 
#Recipe/Snack 
### Ingredients (6 Servings)

-   2¾ oz. dark chocolate with a minimum of 80% cocoa solids
-   2¾ oz. butter
-   ¼ tsp vanilla extract (optional)
-   3 eggs
-   1 tbsp butter, for greasing the ramekins

### Instructions

1.  Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C) and grease 6 small (approximately 3" or 7 cm diameter) ramekins with butter.
    
2.  Divide or chop the chocolate into smaller pieces. Put in a saucepan or the top part of a double boiler. Add butter and melt together on low heat.
    
3.  Add vanilla and stir until smooth. Turn off the heat and set aside. Allow the chocolate to cool, but not too much; you don't want it to harden.
    
4.  Crack the eggs into a bowl and beat with an electric mixer until fluffy and tripled in size — about 2-3 minutes.
    
5.  Pour in the chocolate batter. Mix gently with a whisk to combine until the batter is smooth, but ensure the mixture doesn't collapse too much.
    
6.  Pour the batter into the greased ramekins and place in the oven. Immediately lower the heat to 350°F (175°C).
    
7.  Set your timer for 7-9 minutes. The lava cake is done just as the surface begins to crack.
    
8.  Remove from the oven and serve lukewarm. A dollop of whipped cream or sour cream adds a delicious finishing touch.
