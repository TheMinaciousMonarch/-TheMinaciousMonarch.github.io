# Quick green curry chicken with peanuts

#Recipe/Dinner 
### Ingredients (4 Servings)

-   8 oz. (1½ cups) yellow onions, cut into thin wedges
-   10 oz. (3 cups) fresh [broccoli](https://www.dietdoctor.com/nutrition/broccoli)
-   2 tbsp coconut oil
-   1 lb cooked chicken breasts, sliced
-   14 oz. unsweetened coconut milk
-   1½ tbsp green curry paste
-   2 tbsp unsweetened peanut butter
-   salt and pepper, to taste
-   1½ oz. salted peanuts finely chopped, for topping

### Instructions

1.  Peel the lower part of the broccoli stem with a potato peeler or a small sharp knife. Cut the remaining broccoli into thin rods lengthwise, so that the florets and the stem are still joined together.
    
2.  Heat the oil in a wok or a sauté pan, over high heat. Fry the broccoli and onion for a few minutes, stirring frequently, until crisp-tender.
    
3.  Add the chicken breast, coconut milk, curry paste, and peanut butter to the wok. Stir together, and let it simmer for a few minutes to enhance the flavors. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
    
4.  Just before serving, sprinkle each dish with chopped peanuts! Enjoy.
