QUICK TIPS FOR THE EASY SPINACH SHRIMP PASTA
This spinach shrimp pasta recipe is made with penne, shrimps, in delicious spinach tomato sauce, ready in under 30 minutes. It is healthy, super easy to make, and packed with flavor!

HOW TO MAKE TOMATO SPINACH SHRIMP PASTA?
Keep pasta al dente because they will soak up a bit of the sauce. Also, don’t overcook shrimp at the beginning, they will dry up otherwise.  
Shrimp cooks fast, over-cooked shrimp is rubbery, tough and not pleasant to eat at all. Cook the shrimp stirring frequently, until the shrimp is nice and pink and opaque. This will usually take 2-4 minutes.
Frozen shrimp is okay for this recipe but try as much as possible to buy wild-caught shrimp. fresh wild-caught shrimp tends to have better flavor. You can use shrimp with tails on or off.
We use penne pasta for this recipe, but you can switch for spaghetti or fettuccini. Even linguine is good at this!
To make a gluten-free version: Use gluten-free pasta noodles and rinse them well before adding them to the pan with the other ingredients.
HOW TO STORE AND REHEAT SHRIMP PASTA?
Store any shrimp pasta leftovers in an airtight container for up to 2 -3 days. To reheat, reheat very gently with a splash of chicken broth or water to keep the shrimp and pasta from drying out.

This shrimp pasta recipe can also be frozen, but we find pasta does not retain its texture as well, so we recommend avoiding the freezer if possible.

WHAT TO SERVE WITH THE SHRIMP PASTA
Serve with a side of garlic bread and a fresh green salad. A generous dash of high-quality olive oil is also a plus, but it’s optional.
