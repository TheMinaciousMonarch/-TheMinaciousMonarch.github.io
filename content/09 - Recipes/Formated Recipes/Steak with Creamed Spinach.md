#Recipe/Dinner 
### Ingredients (2 Servings)

-   1 lb sirloin steaks
-   salt and ground black pepper to taste
-   2 tbsp butter
-   7 oz. (6½ cups) fresh spinach
-   2 tbsp heavy whipping cream

### Instructions

1.  Season the steaks on both sides with salt and pepper.
    
2.  Heat a large frying pan over high heat. It's ready when it starts to smoke. Add the steaks. Cook for about 1 minute or until a crust develops.
    
3.  Flip and cook the other side. Add the butter, when melted baste the steaks with butter using a spoon. Cook to your liking (see tip below).
    
4.  Once done, remove the steaks from the pan, and add the spinach to the same pan.
    
5.  Cook the spinach until it wilts down, add the heavy cream and season with salt and pepper. Cook longer for the liquid to evaporate a bit, or leave it more creamy if you wish.
    
6.  Serve the steaks with the creamy spinach.
