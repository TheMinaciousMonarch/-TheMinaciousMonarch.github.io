---
#### Ingredients (4 Servings) 
4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts 
8 oz fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced into 8 slices

#### Instructions 
Preheat your oven to 400 degrees F and grease a 9x13 baking dish with non-stick spray. Lay a chicken breast on your cutting board and cut a deep pocket into it. Repeat with all of the breasts. Stuff each breast with 1 slice of red pepper, 1 slice of mozzarella cheese, and 1/4 of the basil. Tuck it all in really well. Use a toothpick to close it up real well if you want. Sprinkle the tops of the chicken breasts with Italian seasoning. Bake for 40 minutes. Remove the dish from the oven and top the chicken with the remaining mozzarella slices and sprinkle on the parmesan cheese. Broil until the cheese is browned and bubbly, 3-4 minutes. Watch carefully!
