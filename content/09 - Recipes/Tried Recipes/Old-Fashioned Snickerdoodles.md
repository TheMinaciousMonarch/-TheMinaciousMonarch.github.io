2. Make cookies: Beat sugar, butter, shortening, eggs, and vanilla in a large bowl until smooth and creamy.
3. Whisk flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt together in a separate bowl. Gradually mix dry ingredients mixture into the wet ingredients just until combined. Shape dough into walnut-sized balls.
