# Scrambled eggs

#Recipe/Breakfast 

### Ingredients (1 Servings)

-   2 tbsp butter
-   3 large eggs
-   salt and pepper

### Instructions

1.  Crack the eggs into a small bowl and use a fork to whisk them together with some salt and pepper.
2.  Melt the butter in a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Watch carefully — the butter shouldn't turn brown!
3.  Pour the eggs into the skillet and stir for 1–2 minutes, until they are creamy and cooked just the way you like them. Remember that the eggs will still be cooking even after you've put them on your plate.
