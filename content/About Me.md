# Overview

I was born [[March 18th]] 2000. I lived in a trailer on my Grandpa's farm until moving to [[Springfield, Missouri]] in November 2007. I attended [[Campbell Elementary School]] from then until moving to [[Jarrett Middle School]] in August 2010. 

My performance in elementary and middle school was adequate. I tended to be slightly behind average during each performance test we took. Most students at [[Campbell Elementary School]] were from poor and broken home. Many students had behavioral issues and nearly all of them were behind in their education. [[Second Grade Principal's Office Conversation|I had a conversation on the first day of school with my elementary school principal]] which jumpstarted my critical thinking. I recall being disenchanted with education in fourth grade when [[Fourth Grade Lesson|I had a poor interaction with one of the two teachers.]] This lead me to realize that adults are not all on the same [[Level of Adulthood]]. I began to develop system for evaluating other's development which was directly related to my degree of trust in their authority. 

My fifth grade teacher was spectacular and was the first adult in my life who clearly cared about my development. I had a speech and reading comprehension deficit and I stayed after school with her many times to work on my reading. During our reading, she discerned that my reading level was fine, but that I was simply too bored of what I was required to read and as such, I didn't pay attention to it. She had me take a lexile test and I scored 1180, which was the highest the test measured and seven years more advanced than I was.
