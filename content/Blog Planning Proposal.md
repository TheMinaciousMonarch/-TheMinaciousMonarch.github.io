    Write a brief proposal describing your individual blog project. It will be in memo format and addressed to me.
    
    Be sure to describe your approach with a clear career objective, usersâ€™ needs, and how they will be fulfilled. Here are a few items to consider in your planning:
    
    - Purpose: What is your objective? What are you trying to accomplish in this professional blog.? What is/are your communication goals (e.g., to impress an audience, increase your chances of employment, show you have gained a particular skill or expertise, to entertain)?
    - Target audience: Who might look at your professional blog? What do they want out of your blog? What impression would you like them to have of you? What expectations might they hold (aside from the contents, think about the qualities, ideas, and tone of the blog)? Whom do you want to impress the most?
    - Delivery Platform: This will be a blog website.
    
    The maximum recommended length: 1 to 2 pages.
