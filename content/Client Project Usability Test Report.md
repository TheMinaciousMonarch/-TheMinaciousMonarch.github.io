**Usability Test Report: Enhancing Note-Taking Skills Project**

_Introduction:_ The following is a short report on the usability task analysis and design rubric analysis conducted for the completed project, where 8 friends have tested the printout/manual and Obsidian.md blog. One user reported difficulty in navigation, leading to the addition of a description on how to navigate the blog effectively.

**Part 1: Text Analysis** The main text content generated using Hemingway was analyzed for clarity and readability. The content scored well, with a focus on simplicity and ease of understanding.

**Part 2: Task Analysis** The three main tasks identified for the usability test were as follows:

1. **Navigating to Specific Notes:**
    
    - _Objective:_ Users should be able to easily locate and access specific notes on the blog.
    - _Analysis:_ Most users navigated effectively, except for one who found the process challenging. This feedback led to the addition of a navigation guide.
2. **Adding Personal Notes:**
    
    - _Objective:_ Users should be able to contribute their own notes to the blog.
    - _Analysis:_ Users performed this task successfully, indicating an intuitive understanding of the contribution process.
3. **Filtering Notes by Topic:**
    
    - _Objective:_ Users should be able to filter notes based on specific topics or categories.
    - _Analysis:_ The majority of users successfully used the filtering feature, highlighting the effectiveness of this functionality.

**Part 3: Design Rubric Analysis** The overall score of the design rubric analysis was "Meets Expectations." While the majority of aspects met or exceeded expectations, some issues were identified:

- **Titles/Subtitles:** While most titles and subtitles were clear, a few lacked clarity and did not enhance readability uniformly.
    
- **Text Size and Color:** Generally well-managed, but some inconsistencies in text size and color affected the overall understanding.
    
- **Quality of Information:** While information was clear and complete, minor improvements in conciseness could enhance user experience.
    
- **Consistency of Structure:** The structure was generally consistent, but there were minimal variations in conventions and structure.
    
- **Navigation Structure:** The navigation structure was generally clear, but one user reported difficulties. The addition of a navigation guide aimed to address this issue.
    

**Conclusion:** The usability test indicates overall success in achieving the project goals. The addition of a navigation guide has addressed the reported issue, enhancing the user experience. To further improve the document, we recommend refining text size and color consistency and ensuring uniform clarity in titles and subtitles.
