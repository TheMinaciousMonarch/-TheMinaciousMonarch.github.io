### Fourth Grade Lesson

*Situation*: I was expected to know something which I am confident I was not taught. The teacher, being an impatient adult, frightened me by saying they would call the principal from my previous elementary school to ask if the content I was supposed to have learned was in their curriculum. While I was confident that I had not learned whatever it was, I was more worried about bothering said principal. 

*Lesson*: I realized at that time that her method was one which did not encourage me being honest about my lack of education and that I was being pressured into claiming knowledge I did not have rather than the teacher spending the minute or so explaining how to do what I needed to. I considered that if this situation were more common, that the world would be filled with people who act like they know what they do not know. I then considered that it is possible that many adults know far less than they act like they do.
