# Introduction

Hello and thank you for checking out this video.

The focus of this video is for those who have no idea how to start note-taking, and the purpose is to reframe the way you think about note-taking if you are struggling with it.

I did not have to take school notes until college, and as such I never developed note-taking skills; I realized this in college and I attempted to learn how to take notes. I learned much about varous systems of note-taking and note-organizing, and I was inspired to start taking notes. Though I took notes, I did not get any better at note-taking. I eventually stopped from note-taking burnout.

I started re-learning note-taking a couple of years later after a head injury which substantially reduced what I can remember. 

I am not an expert in note-taking, *and* I would say no one is. Luckily, *or unluckily*, I am learning how to take notes from scratch and sharing what I *have* learned. 

Simply put, I thought about note-taking the wrong way and as such I couldn't ask the right questions. Once I grasped the questions I needed to ask, I realized that I could not find anyone answering them.

In searching for those answers, I realized that the reason I could not get into the flow of note-taking is because the bridge from knowing to doing is a skill and skills are developed not learned. I was relying on those with the knowledge and skill to explain the process from start to finish, instead they explain step one and step five, expecting you to intuit the inbetween steps. 

This makes sense. If you started learning a skill when you were five, you likely don't remember how you started and how the little things didn't make sense at first. 

If you look up a recipe for pancake batter you'll find a list of ingredients. If you throw them all together and mix it, you have ready-to-use batter. This said, if no one explains that you have to pour it in a pan at a specific temperature, that you must flip it, and so on, you'll be stuck with batter and confused as to how everyone is getting a pancake when you're just getting batter.

My guess is that you have batter, my goal is to explain how to cook it.

The first step though is to realize that you are too focused on making pancakes, instead, cook your batter and see what you make.

I am not teaching you how to make pancakes, or to specify, I am not teaching you a note-taking system. I am only teaching you the in between steps so that you can aquire the experience needed to undertand the recipe in full.

# Abstract

Here is all you need to know before we begin cooking.

1. **Knowing your specific purpose to take notes will ease the process of taking notes.** In other words, if you know you want to make a pancake you'll find it easer to take notes than someone who does not know what they want to make and does not know if they even want to make anything.
2. **Knowing how to take notes comes from reviewing notes, not taking notes. But if you do not take notes, you have nothing to review.**

The steps to note taking are these

Part One
1. Find a purpose to take a note.
2. Clarify your purpose.
3. Brainstorm note-taking requirments.
4. Forget about the future.
5. Consume content
6. Quote what fulfills your purpose.
7. Summarize quote.

Part Two 
1. Report findings.
2. Test knowledge.
3. Review.

That's all. But there are likely little rules inbetween preventing you from bridging the gap and completing your recipe. Do not follow those rules like a recipe. If you do, you will fail. The rules are ways of explaining the mindset. The mindset leads to review.

Because of this, I will provide a couple of specific examples of this process. I chose to avoid abstract examples as those require an understanding of the rules. Specific examples fail when someone lacks knowledge of a term, but specific examples can lead to bells ringing.

I will add follow-up examples in this playlist as they come to me. None of these are the way to take notes, they're examples of how to think so as to know how you should take notes.

# Examples

## Student in a philosophy class

John is taking a class on the History of Philosophy. The class has three tests and two essays. One test is on Aristotle, one is on Descartes, and one is on Hume. The for the essays, one will focus on Descartes, and one will focus on Hegel. 

John has no idea what the tests or essays will look like. He does not want to ask his teacher. 

John has the note-taking purpose of passing this class. 

To clarify this purpose, John writes these;

1. I must pass one test on Aristotle.
2. I must pass one test on Descartes.
3. I must pass one test on Hume.
4. I must pass an essay on Descartes
5. I must pass an essay on Hegel

Now, John considered what he'll need for his notes. He decides that the tests will likely just require him to re-state facts or arguments made by each given philosopher. For the essay, John wants notes he can easily refer back to so as to not have to re-read the books when the time come to write the essay.

Now, John stops thinking about the essays and tests. He knows that he needs to remember arguments or other basic facts, and he want to minimize the need to look back in his book when he writes an essay. Given that he has forgotten the future, he is focused on passing the Aristotle test.

John thinks about how he could make notes that achieve this. Knowing that he wants things to be simple, he decides to write very short notes which express a very clear fact or argument. 

During class, John directly quote, or paraphrases what his teacher says. He writes notes like, "Aristotle is an Ancient Greek Philosopher.", "Plato was Aristotle's mentor.", "Socrates was Plato's mentor.", "To Aristotle, a virtuous life is inherently a happy life." etc...

They are also reading The Nicomachean Ethics by Aristotle. While reading this,
