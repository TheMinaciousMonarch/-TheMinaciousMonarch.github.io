You want your notes to aid in your academic performance. You likely need your notes to help you remember the content of your class but the kind of memory and kind of content vary. There are really only four kinds of academic content, skills, theories, jargon, and events. Skills are physical capabilities to perform some task. Theories are the abstract or prodecural knowledge about how to do soemthing or how that thing works. Jargon is anything which could be written in some variation of "This thing means that." Events would be anything which has some form of linear progression.

Questions asking 'what is', 'true or false' or 'how many' will nearly always be asking for jargon.
Questions asking you to explain 'why' or 'what happened' are nearly always events
Questions asking 'what would happen if' are nearly always asking about theory
Anything which requires you to perform something is testing your skills.

Math is largely centered around skills and theory.
Science is largely centered around jargon and theory.
English is largely centered around theory and events.
Social Studies is largely centered around jargon and events.
